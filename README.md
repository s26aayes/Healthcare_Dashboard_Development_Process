This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of healthcare wait list data, segmented by case types and time periods. Key features include:
KPI Cards displaying the latest monthâ€™s wait list total (709K) and comparison with the previous year (640K).
A Donut Chart breaking down total values by Case_Type (Outpatient, Day Case, Inpatient).
Multiple Slicer Filters allowing users to interactively filter data by:
Archive Date
Medical Specialty
Case Type
Wait Time Metric (Median/Average)
A Bar Chart showing Avg/Med Wait List by Time_Bands, highlighting long-term wait time distribution.
Line Charts tracking the trend in total values over time, both for individual case types and overall trends.
